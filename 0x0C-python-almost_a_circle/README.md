Directory : 0x0C-python-almost_a_circle


## Description
The "0x0C-python-almost_a_circle" project is a Python-based program that implements a set of classes and methods to model and manipulate geometric shapes. In particular, it focuses on two primary geometric shapes: rectangles and squares. This project is intended to serve as a foundation for understanding object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python and exploring concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several modules and directories, each serving a specific purpose:

models: This directory contains the main modules for creating and managing geometric shapes.

1. Directory models contain :
base.py: The Base class provides the foundation for all other shape classes, handling the management of unique IDs.
rectangle.py: The Rectangle class represents and manipulates rectangular shapes.
square.py: The Square class represents and manipulates square shapes.
tests: This directory contains unit tests for the various classes and methods in the project.

2. Directory tests contain :
test_models/: Subdirectory containing test cases for the shape classes.
